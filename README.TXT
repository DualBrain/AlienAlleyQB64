Ah... After a long long time, I got my paws wet in the land of
programming. How exciting! Anyways, this is a
FreeBASIC/Allegro/Win32 port/conversion of the Alien Alley
game by Dave Roberts. The same game that came with the book PC
Game Programming Explorer. I bought this book a long time ago
and indeed what a wonderful book it is. The original game was
written in C for DOS. The conversion was not very simple
though. A lot has changed in the code. If you want to compile
the code, you will need FreeBASIC and FBEdit. Notice, that the
game now runs in 640x480x8 display mode. As usual, I do not
accept responsibility for any effects, adverse or otherwise,
that this code may have on you, your computer, your sanity,
your dog, and anything else that you can think of. Use it at
your own risk.

Release 1.0
November 13, 1994

Alien Alley is a vertically scrolling, fast action video game.
The player controls a defending spaceship, flying though the
cosmos.  Advancing alien spaceships make difficult foes as they
advance on the lone defender, firing plasma cannons at will.
How long can the defender hold out until he is finally overrun?
Only you can say...

INSTALLATION
============
Alien Alley may be installed by simply unzipping all the files
in the archive to a single directory.  Alien Alley includes
sound drivers for the Advanced Gravis UltraSound and Sound Blaster
compatibles.  To install the UltraSound drivers, run the
SETGUS.BAT batchfile by typing "setgus" at the DOS prompt.  To
install the Sound Blaster compatible drivers, run SETSB.BAT by
typing "setsb".  The UltraSound drivers require that you run
UltraMID before running the game itself.  If UltraMID is not
run, the UltraSound drivers will not load.  UltraMID can be run
easily using the "e.exe" utility that comes with your UltraSound
software.

ABOUT ALIEN ALLEY
=================
Alien Alley was created as an example for the book PC Game
Programming Explorer, by Dave Roberts.  Alien Alley demonstrates
many of the game programming concepts and techniques described
in PC Game Programming Explorer, including joystick, mouse,
and keyboard programming, fast page flipping animation, VGA
palette effects, music and sound, and a scrolling background.

PC Game Programming Explorer includes all the source code used
to create Alien Alley as well as the source code for many other
projects developed in the book.

PC Game Programming Explorer, by Dave Roberts, is available
for US$34.95 at a bookstore near you or directly from Coriolis
Group Books.

Sound Drivers
=============
To keep the size of this archive down, Alien Alley is distributed
with just two audio drivers.  Alien Alley uses audio drivers
from The Audio Solution's DigPak and MidPak.  If you own something
other than an UltraSound or a Sound Blaster, chances are that
DigPak/MidPak drivers exist for your sound card.  To get all
the audio drivers, call the BBS at 314-939-0200 and look for
the DigPak/MidPak developers kit (DMKIT.ZIP) in the main file
library.

DMKIT.ZIP also includes all the files necessary to develop an
application around DigPak/MidPak.  If you are a game developer,
take a look at DIGPKAPI.DOC and MIDPKAPI.DOC.

REDISTRIBUTION
==============
Alien Alley may be, and is encouraged to be, redistributed
throughout the world.  All files in the original archive MUST
remain intact, however.  No files may be altered or removed.
Under no circumstances may this program be sold for a fee.

In summary, make as many copies of this archive as you want as
long as you: (1) keep all the files together, and (2) don't
sell it.
